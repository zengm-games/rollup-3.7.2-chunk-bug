				<h2>Auto save</h2>

				<p>
					By default, your league is automatically saved as you play. Usually
					this is what you want. But sometimes you might want to experiment with
					re-playing parts of the game multiple times. When your league is saved
					automatically, you can't easily do that.
				</p>
				<p>
					To enable that kind of experimentation, here you can disable auto
					saving. This is not well tested and could break things, but it seems
					to generally work.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you play enough seasons with auto saving disabled, things will get
					slow because it has to keep everything in memory. But within a single
					season, disabling auto saving will actually make things faster.
				</p>

				<p>
					This setting is only temporary. If you restart your browser or switch
					to another league, auto save will be enabled again.
				</p>

				<AutoSave autoSave={autoSave} godMode={godMode} />

				<h2 className="mt-5">Worker console</h2>

				<p>
					If all the God Mode settings aren't enough for you, you can do more
					advanced customization by running some code that modifies your league.{" "}
