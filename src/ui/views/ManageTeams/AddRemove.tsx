					<p>
						You can disable a team by changing its <b>Status</b> from "Active"

					</p>
					<p>
						When a team is disabled, all its players become free agents. Because
						of this, the best time to disable a team is right after the playoffs
						finish. Then the draft and free agency can proceed like normal, just
						with fewer teams.
					</p>
					<p>
						Team history is preserved for disabled teams, and disabled teams can
						be re-enabled in the future, either here or in an{" "}
